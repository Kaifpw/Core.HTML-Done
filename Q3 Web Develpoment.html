        <h1>Web Development</h1>

        <p>
            Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building,
            and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. 
            It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.
            <br>

            There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.
            <br>

            Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work itself is often broken down into three types: 
            <br>

            <b>Front-end development:-</b> Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI). 
            Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, 
            while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device types.
            <br>

            <b>Back-end development:-</b> Back-end development is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see. 
            This is also known as server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site. 

            <br>

            <b>Full-stack development:-</b> Full-stack development is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the site or app take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end developers.
